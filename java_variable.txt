Declaring avariable
Java cares about type.

variables must have a type Besides a type, a variable needs a name, so that
you can use that name in code.



Primitive Types

numeric (all are signed)

integer

byte 8 bits -128 to 127

short 16 bits -32768 to 32767

int 32 bits -2147483648 to 2147483647

long 64 bits -huge to huge


floating point

float 32 bits varies
double 64 bits varies


Primitive declarations with assignments:

int x;

x = 234;

byte b = 89;

boolean isfun = true;

double d = 3456.98;

char c ='f';

int z=x;

boolean IsPunkRock;

isPunkRock = false;

boolean powerOn;

powerOn = IsFun;

float f = 32.5;
